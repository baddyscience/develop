# develop

Baddyscience's learning repository, a record of completed school works and some simple algorithmic exercises - mainly from leetcode and luogu.

## alogorithmTopic

- only code


## cppStudy

- use *GCC*
- Includes a description of the topic
- Part of the code is commented *(PS: what's not there won't be made up)* :)
- 不怕钟sir双杀你就cv :)

## JavaStudy

- use *jdk1.8/jre1.8*
- Includes a practice project ‘Pokemon’ and will soon include related school assignments
  - ‘Pokemon’ Using the *interllij* system provided by *IDEA*, some of the basics including polymorphism were applied
- Part of the code is commented  *((PS: what's not there won't be added) PS's PS: as usual)* :)
- 不怕 ? sir双杀你就cv :)

## operatingSystem

- use cpp
- Some simple algorithms for completing school assignments


## simulationExperiment

- No built-in compilation environment
- Primarily using python in Jupyter (most I guess
- Part of the code has markdown instructions
- Part of the code is commented

## stm32

- use Vu5(MDK534,Keil.STM32F1xx_DFP.2.4.0)
- use stm32F103RB Xtal 8.00
